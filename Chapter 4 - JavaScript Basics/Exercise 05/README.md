# Exercise 5

Create the variables `isDoorClosed` and `isDogOutside`. Set the `isDoorClosed` variable to true and `isDogOutside` variable to false. Run the script. Try to invert the variables values and see what happens.

// Create the variables here

// Don't modify this block. This is an if statement, you'll study it later in this course.
if (isDoorClosed == true && isDogOutside == false) {
console.log("the door is closed and the dog is inside");
} else if (isDoorClosed == false && isDogOutside == true) {
console.log("The door is open and the dog is outside");
} else console.log("Modify the variables values");
