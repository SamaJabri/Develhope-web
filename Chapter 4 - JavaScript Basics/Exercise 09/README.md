# Exercise 9

* Try to predict the output of the comparisons before printing them in the console

const name = "Mario";
const lastname = "Rossi";
const age = 27;
const isGraduated = false;
const average = 27;
const examsCompleted = 10;
const firstYearCompleted = true;
const yearsCompleted = 1;

name == lastname
age <= average
firstYearCompleted == lastname
yearsCompleted == firstYearCompleted
firstYearCompleted === yearsCompleted
examsCompleted < age
isGraduated > yearsCompleted
