# Exercise 31

* Create two functions: the first one is called `sayHelloName` and takes is as parameter another function (the second one) called `printName`.
* The `printName` function should just execute the console.log() method and print the name. The `sayHelloName` that takes in the callback as parameter, must execute the console.log() of the "Hello" string and after that invoke the function taken in as parameter.
