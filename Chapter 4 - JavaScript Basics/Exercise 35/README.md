# Exercise 35

If you run this function, you'll get an error. Fix the function and explain briefly what's wrong.

function canPlay() {
let sport = " Football";

if (true) {
let personName = "Cosimo";
}

console.log(personName + sport);
}

canPlay();

**Suggestion**
Be careful with the variables scope.
